## Todo

- [x] WebSocket transport for JVM
- [x] WebRTC transport for ClojureScript
- [ ] Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) support for JVM

## Overview

reelthyme provides a simple, core.async-driven API for interacting with OpenAI's Realtime API. On the JVM it uses WebSocket, while ClojureScript will leverage WebRTC. Use it to build multimodal, real-time conversational experiences with minimal boilerplate.

## Key Concepts

- **connect!**: Opens a session channel for sending client events and receiving server events. On the JVM this uses WebSocket, while in ClojureScript it uses WebRTC and manages audio playback automatically.  
- **stream!** (JVM only): Splits incoming server events into a filtered event channel and an audio stop function.  
- **capture-audio!** (JVM only): Streams microphone input into the session as audio-buffer events.  
- **core.async channels**: All data flows via clojure.core.async channels and go blocks for composability.

## Basic Usage

Start a REPL and require the namespaces:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [reelthyme.core :as rt]
            [reelthyme.schema :as sc]
            [clojure.core.async :as a]))
```

### 1. Connect

Open a realtime session, with optional event validation:

```clojure
;;; JVM 
(def session-ch
  (rt/connect! {:xf-in (map sc/validate)})  ;; validate outgoing events
  
;;; ClojureScript
(def session-ch
  (rt/connect! session {:xf-in (map sc/validate)})) ;;; session is fetched from a server
```

`reelthyme.core/create-session` is included as a convenient server-side function for creating sessions fit for WebRTC.

On the JVM, authentication can be provided as an `:api-key` option, or the default will attempt to use
the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. WebRTC requires some work on your own server. See [Connection details](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime#connect-with-webrtc) in the OpenAI WebRTC docs.

The `reelthyme.schema` namespace is completely optional. The `validate` function provided by it is a great
addition to the development environment to ensure properly constructed client events are being sent.

### 2. Stream Events

Separate audio deltas from other events (JVM):

```clojure
;;; Receive server events as plain Clojure maps
(let [[event-ch stop-audio] (rt/stream! session-ch)]
  (a/go-loop []
    (when-let [ev (a/<! event-ch)]
      (println "Server event:" ev)
      (recur))))
```

Or just read from the single session channel when using WebRTC:

```clojure
;;; Receive server events as plain Clojure maps
(a/go-loop []
    (when-let [ev (a/<! session-ch)]
      (println "Server event:" ev)
      (recur)))
```

### 3. Send Messages

Send client events as plain Clojure maps. 

```clojure
;; Send a text message
(a/put! session-ch
        {:type "conversation.item.create"
         :item {:type "message"
                :role "user"
                :content [{:type "input_text"
                           :text "What is the weather today?"}]}})

;; Request both text and audio response
(a/put! session-ch
        {:type "response.create"
         :response {:modalities ["text" "audio"]}})
```

### 4. Capture Microphone Audio

We must explicitly initiate audio capture in the JVM

```clojure
(def stop-capture
  (rt/capture-audio! session-ch {:interval-ms 500}))

;; Later, stop capturing
(stop-capture)
```

WebRTC will initiate audio capture if the session is created with an "audio" modality. If "audio" is not one of the requested modalities (for some reason), a silent AudioContext will be used for the RTCPeerConnection (some form of audio context is required by OpenAI). WebRTC audio capture and playback are handled automatically based on the details of the session. There is no need to explicitly start capture or stop audio. Everything is automatically started when the channel conencts, and stopped when it is closed.

## Example Workflow (JVM)

1. **connect!** opens and authenticates the channel.  
2. **stream!** routes audio to an audio thread and events to your go-loop.  
3. **capture-audio!** pushes live audio chunks into the session.  
4. Use **core.async** puts and takes to drive your application logic.

## Example Workflow (ClojureScript with WebRTC)

1. **connect!** opens an RTCPeerConnection over WebRTC, handles audio playback, and sets up a data channel for events.  
2. No need for **stream!** or **capture-audio!** â€” audio is managed natively via the browser's WebRTC APIs.  
3. Consume server events directly from the channel returned by `connect!`, which yields ClojureScript maps.  
4. Use **core.async** puts and takes to send client events or process server events.

## Differences between ClojureScript and Clojure

The ClojureScript version of connect! requires a session with an ephemeral client secret:

```clojure
;;; JVM
(connect! params)

;;; ClojureScript
(connect! session params)
```

It should also be noted that browsers often impose restrictions on creating audio contexts of any kind without user interaction. This means that ClojureScript implementations will likely have to put connect! behind a user interaction (such as a click).

Check out the [example ClojureScript application](dev/example/webrtc.cljs). It might also be helpful to see the [example handler](dev/example/handler.clj) used to create sessions.

## Next Steps

- Explore `reelthyme.schema` for built-in event validation.  
- Customize transports and logging via `:xf-in`, `:xf-out`, `:ex-handler`, `:log-fn` options.  
- Build responsive UIs or backends that react to real-time OpenAI events.

## Note on Acoustic Echo Cancellation:

Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) can be used to prevent awkward experiences where an agent hears itself and gets stuck in an infinite loop speaking to itself. AEC comes standard with WebRTC, so this issue should not surface when using it. If using the websocket transport on the JVM, you maybe have a better experience using a headset or disabling vads for a more "push to talk" approach.
